# Final Presentation Guidelines

## All Semester
- Work on your project/projects with main elements from the class

## Before the Final
- Collect screenshots of you running your project(s)
- Generate any diagrams to describe your project
- Combine them into a demo reel between 1:30 and 2 minutes w/o audio
- Upload to VuJa
- Get the minified, public link to submit
- Practice your presentation

## During the Final
- Talk to the class as if you were talking to an interviewer
- Be positive and honest
- Talk about the items that are on the final rubric

## Reminders
- Skipping the final will result in an FW
- Don't show code, use diagrams if you need to explain things
- Don't go ever 2:00. Videos that are too long lose points as do videos that are too short to convey what you did.
- Do speak to the class, not the projector
