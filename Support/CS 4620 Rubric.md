Draft rubric for the final presentation/project in CSCI 4620

# 3D Representation

## 3D Representation: Modeling
Demonstrate a knowledge of meshes (model and world space) and their representation in 3D

## 3D Representation: Textures/Shading
Demonstrates an understanding of UVs, normals, and shaders.

## 3D Representation: Key Framing & Rigging
Demonstrates a knowledge of key framing and rigging with armatures and bones.

# Rasterizer 

## Rasteriezer: CPU-GPU Communication
Shows a program written from scratch (in any major language) that communicates between the CPU and GPU

## Rasterizer: Vertex Shader
Shows a vertex shader (in a CPU-bound rasterizer or GPU-bound rasterizer) that a student has created.

## Rasterizer: Fragment Shader
Shows a fragment shader (in a CPU-bound shader or a GPU-bound shader) that the student has customized.

## Rasterizer: OBJ Import
Shows a model generated by the student that is exported as an OBJ and imported into the rasterizer

# Ray Tracer

## Ray Tracer: Recursive Rays

## Ray Tracer: Shaders

## Ray Tracer: Triangulated Objects

## Ray Tracer: Perspective Camera
Ray tracer shows a perspective camera
