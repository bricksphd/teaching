## After the final

- I will grade your final based on your content and presentation:
    -The presentation grade will be all about your, well, presentation. Did you create a demo reel? Was it 2 minutes or less? Did you present as if to an interviewer? Were you confident?
    - The content grade is about what you show during the final. This one boils down to one question: Do you demonstrate mastery of the main topics in the course? 
- I will put the finals grades in Canvas.

- I Usually get grades into the registrars office by the end of the day or early the next morning.
