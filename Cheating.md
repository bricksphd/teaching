#  Cheating Policy

The penalty for cheating is a 0 for the assignment in question. A second violations will result in a student being reported to the deanâ€™s office and the student being dropped from the class.  

In addition to blatant cheating, I consider it cheating if you do not cite in a comment your source. 
This includes websites, the instructor, class notes, classmates, friends, family, etc. 
__I also consider it cheating to copy and paste.__
If you have an approprite situation where you can use others' code, cite it and type it out yourself. When in doubt, use common sense or ask the instructor.
