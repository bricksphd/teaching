The cheating policy in this course is defined by three documents: the Universitites policy on academic integrity, the Computer Science Department policy on academic integrity, and this document. When determining if an activity violates academic integrity and what the consequence will be, the stricter of the policies will apply.

 
## Golden Rule of Cheating

Any activity that a reasonable student would consider cheating is in a violation of academic integrity.

## Suggestions

- Always add comments in your code telling where the ideas came from, for example, `// From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort`.
- Stay away from other's code. Instead use resources that talk about a concept using diagrams or written descriptions.
  - It is okay to study code if you need help with syntax, for example, a Stackoverflow question about how to write a for loop.
  - If you are copying and pasting code or trascribing code, you are most likely in violation of academic integrity.
  - You are free to study any code the instructor posts. You cannot, however copy and paste it. If you want to use it, you must transcribe it.
