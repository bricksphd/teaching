#  Cheating Policy

The penalty for cheating is a 0 for the assignment in question. A second violations will result in a student being reported to the deanâ€™s office and the student being dropped from the class.  

The following are considered cheating in this course:
- Anything a reasonable student would recognize as cheating. I call this blatant cheating.
- Getting ideas from a source without citing that source (usually you would cite sources in your code's comments). You need to cite websites (including StackOverflow and YouTube), classmates, friends, family, etc. Anything that does not come directly from the instructor needs to be cited.
- Copying and pasting anything from any external source. If you find a code snippet on StackOverflow (etc.) that reminds you how to write a for loop, don't copy and paste it, type it out yourself. It is perfectly ok to copy and paste code from one of your projects to another or from one part of a project to another part. I just want you to practice, practice, and practice.

During class, if I provide a starter file for a lecture, you are free to use that template. You can copy what you write in class into your own projects, but you should type out any code that came directly from the instructor.

When in doubt about cheating, use common sense and/or talk to the instructor.
