## Policies

:hourglass: All grades are final a week after the grade is posted or when the final starts, whichever comes sooner. The grade for the final is final at close of business the day of the final.

:warning: I enforce all CS department course policies, including the attendance and plagiarism policy (see the [policy document](https://github.com/bricksphd/teaching/blob/master/CSPolicies.docx) in this repository). 
Most semesters I have to drop or fail a student for lack of attendance. 
**You will not be an exception.** 

:rotating_light: I do not tolerate visa, scholarship, and/or student loan fraud. If you enrolled in this class just to fulfil the requirements of your visa/scholarship/loan and don't attend class or perform at a minimum level, I will drop you from the class and contact the relevant stakeholders. 

:heavy_check_mark: Much of the grading in this class is subjective.  By taking this class, you agree to accept my subjective grading.
