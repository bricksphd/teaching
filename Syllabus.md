# Class Policies

- This class uses a standard grading scale.
- Please do not wear AirPods, etc. even if they are transparency mode, unless it is during free time when you can work on your projects (e.g., sprint time).
- All grades are final a week after the are posted.
- Please keep this class a welcoming place by never having explicit content.

# Attendance

- I expect you to be in class on time. Class starts at the time indicated on the registrars website, regardless of when I start taking roll.
- I reserve the right to mark you tardy if you miss part of class even if it is not at the beginning of class.
- I will mark you absent if you miss a large part of class.
- I will mark you absent if you attend class but blatantly do not participate in class activities when specifically asked to do so.
- Per the Computer Science Department Policies, if you have four unexcused absences, you will be dropped from the class. You will also automatically fail the class if you do not take the final.
- In addition to the policy above, your grade will decrease if you have excessive combined tardies/absences. For every four combined tardies/absences, you grade will go down one grade step (e.g. A->A-, B+->B, etc.)

# Cheating/AI

- The cheating policy of this class is defined by the university policy on academic integrity and the Computer Science Policy of academic integrity.
- When determining if use of AI violates either of those policies, I treat AI as if it were a "person" in those policies. If your use of the AI would violate either of those policies if the AI were a person, then the full consequences of cheating will be applied.
- This does not mean you can never use AI. Just as you can ask others (or the internet) for basic help, AI can be a useful tool as long as you are still doing your own work.

# AI FAQ

- I had AI contribute significantly to my code (or debugging). Afterword I studied the changes in detail and commented them. Am I still cheating?Â 
   - Yes. If you asked another person to contribute to your code significantly and then studied the changes in detail and commented them, it would be cheating.
- I had AI contribute significantly to my code (or debugging). Afterword I attributed the work to AI. Am I still cheating?
   - Yes. If someone contributed significantly to your code (or debugging) and you attributed it to them, it would still be cheating.
- At work I am encouraged to use AI as much as possible. Why is class different?
   - It is normal to be encouraged to use all resources (both human and AI) in an employment environment. Nonetheless, since there are no group projects in this class, your work still needs to be your work as defined in the academic integrity policies.
- Does this mean I can never use AI?
   - No. It is appropriate to use the internet and other learn and do simple debugging. Similar use of AI is appropriate.
