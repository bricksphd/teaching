## Awkward Addendum 

Previous students created awkward moments when they forget what they do at home follows them to class. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You can learn from these real examples. Not repeating these scenarios will make the classroom feel safe and inclusive.

üíª	Student brings their personal laptop to class or my office, forgetting they have an explicit image on their desktop.

üì≤ Student pulls out their phone during class to silence a call, forgetting they have an explicit image on their phone.

üí¨	A student adds some choice words in a code comment outside of class, forgetting that in class those words will still be there.

üìΩÔ∏è Student appropriately brings up a YouTube tutorial during sprint time but forgets that YouTube‚Äôs personal recommendations for them include explicit content.
