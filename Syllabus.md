# Course Policies

## Classroom Policies

1. Please keep this class a welcoming place by never having explicit content.
1. Please do not wear headphones or earbuds during class (even if they are transparency mode) unless it is during free time when you can work on your projects.

## Grading Policies
1. All grades are final a week after the are posted or when the final starts, which ever comes sooner.

## Attendance Policies

1. I expect you to be in class on time. Class starts at the time indicated on the registrar's website, regardless of when I start taking roll.
2. I reserve the right to mark you tardy if you miss part of class even if it is not at the beginning of class.
1. I will mark you absent if you miss a large part of class.
1. I will mark you absent if you attend class but blatantly do not participate in class activities when specifically asked to do so.
1. You must attend Sprint days to receive credit on that sprint day. The only exception are excused absences.

## Attendance Grade Policy
1. I track the number of combined unexcused tardies and unexcused absences, aka attendance violations.
1. After 2 attendance violations, you will start losing points at a rate of 20 points per additional attendance violation.
1. Per the Computer Science Department Policies, if you have four unexcused absences, you will be dropped from the class.
1. You will also automatically fail the class if you do not take the final.

## Cheating/AI

1. The cheating policy of this class is defined by the university policy on academic integrity and the Computer Science Policy of academic integrity.
   1. The instructor will post code during the semester. You are free to use this code as a reference. You can even transcribe its contents (not including comments), but you may not copy directly in any electronic way.
1. When determining if use of AI violates academic integrity policies, I treat AI as if it were a "person". If your use of the AI would violate either of those policies by that standard, then the full consequences of cheating will be applied.
   1. This does not mean you can never use AI. Just as you can ask others (or the internet) for basic help, AI can be a useful tool as long as you are still doing your own work.
1. The minimum consequence for cheating is a 0 on the respective assignment. If cheating is identified during a sprint, the minimum consequence will be a 0 on that sprint's score.
   

## AI FAQ

1. I had AI contribute significantly to my code (or debugging). Afterword I studied the changes in detail and commented them. Am I still cheating? 
   1. Yes. If you asked another person to contribute to your code significantly and then studied the changes in detail and commented them, it would be cheating.
1. I had AI contribute significantly to my code (or debugging). Afterword I attributed the work to AI. Am I still cheating?
   1. Yes. If someone contributed significantly to your code (or debugging) and you attributed it to them, it would still be cheating.
1. At work I am encouraged to use AI as much as possible. Why is class different?
   1. Companies have diferent AI policies to produce quality products. In a classroom environment, the "product" is each student, and the best way to create a quality student is by having everyone do their own work as defined in the academic integrity policies.
1. Does this mean I can never use AI?
   1. No. It is appropriate to use the internet and other people to learn and do simple debugging. Similar use of AI is appropriate.
