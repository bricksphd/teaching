:heavy_check_mark: Much of the grading in this class is subjective.  By taking this class, you agree to accept my subjective grading.
 
 ## Warnings

:rotating_light: I enforce all CS department course policies, including the attendance and plagiarism policy (see the [policy document](https://github.com/bricksphd/teaching/blob/master/CSPolicies.docx) in this repository). 
Most semesters I have to drop or fail a student for lack of attendance. 
**You will not be an exception.** 

:rotating_light: I do not tolerate fraud. If you enrolled in this class just to fulfil the requirements of your visa/scholarship/loan and don't attend class or perform at a minimum level, I will drop you from the class and contact the relevant stakeholders. **You will not be an exception.** 

:rotating_light: I do not regrade or change grades unless there has been a clear error. I have refused to change grades even though it meant students: had to leave the country due to visa restrictions,  couldn't graduate on time, had to take the course again, couldn't take a follow-on course, failed to make the honor roll, etc. **You will not be an exception.**
