## Policies
- Standard grading scale, see GradingScale.md
- All grades are final a week after the grade is posted or when the final starts, which ever comes sooner.
- The grade for the final is final at close of business the day of the final.

- I enforce all CS department course policies, including the attendance and plagarism policy (see the [policy document](https://github.com/bricksphd/teaching/blob/master/CSPolicies.docx) in this repository). 
Most semesters I have to drop or fail a student for lack of attendance. 
**You will not be an exception.**

- I do not tolerate scholarship/student loan fraud. If you are taking the class with no intention of completing it, I will drop you from the class.
- Much of the grading in this class is subjective.  By taking this class, you agree to live with subjective grading.
- For students with disabilities: I *will* work with you, but you will receive no accomodation unless you go through Disability Services. You also must talk to me directly before I can give you any acconomatation.
