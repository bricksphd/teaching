For the first three weeks, we will have a lecture every day we have class. After that, the first time we meet during the week will be called a “sprint day.” During a sprint day there will be no formal lecture. You will spend class time working on your project. I will spend class time talking to as many of you as possible. I will periodically share something with the entire class as needed.

At the beginning of a sprint day, you will fill out a self-assessment. You will be asked to give a quick summary of what you have been working on. Then you will grade yourself based on your participation and effort outside of class. If you worked hours and hours outside of class on this class during the last week, then you can give yourself full marks. I will review the self-assessments and assign a final grade for that week.

The second day of class each week will be a traditional lecture. Your attendance is required on both sprint and lecture days.
