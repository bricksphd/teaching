# Spring-based course

## The Problem

In my previous courses, the traditional homework->project->test model wasn’t fulfilling the needs of my students. Homework often was seen as busy work, was too easy (solve by Google) or too hard (read the professor’s mind), or so hard to grade the feedback came too late to be useful. Tests often had many of the same problems. Projects were even more problematic. Creating a one-size-fits-all-students project often proved impossible, led to cheating, and nurtured an expectation that projects should simply be a small modification of the code used in class. Additionally, I felt my approach fostered the unhealthy memorize-and-repeat learning pattern that doesn’t create exceptional computer science students. And I haven’t mentioned that students felt little motivation to do assignments other than to get them done…

## The Solution

Hence a sprint-based course. The idea is simple. As a student, pick something relevant to the course and work on it outside of class. Once every two weeks (a sprint) I’ll sit down with you personally in class to discuss your progress, answer questions, and review what you’re learning. That’s it.  You work on what you want to work on and we talk about it together in class. Plus a short presentation at the end of the semester to tie it off.

Here are the details. You can work on anything that is relevant to the class. Write a program that uses what we’re talking about, or follow on online tutorial to start on something difficult, or simply make a video that teaches what you’ve been learning. The key is that you choose and if you choose something you’re interested in, you’ll be far more motivated to do it. And hopefully you’ll learn more through practical experience. You aren’t constrained to work on the same item all semester. Experiment and learn as long as you have something solid to present at the end of the semester.

Oh, yes, you may work in groups, but you don’t have to. Remember that everything you do after school will be a group project (it’s true!), so developing those soft skills is key to a happy career. Also know that you can talk to me anytime outside of class, our bi-weekly lab meetings aren’t the only time we have together.

## Grading

Every other class period will be designated a “end of sprint day”. I’ll spend at least half of the class talking with students about their last two weeks (their last sprint). You are free to work on anything related to the class on sprint days as you wait to talk to me. Often this is interrupted by a brief discussion about questions I’m hearing frequently. If I get through half the class, I’ll continue to present material. Note that if I do half the class once a week, I’ll get through every student every two weeks.  

This one-on-one in-class meeting is a big part of your grade. I’ll give you a score out of 10 points at every one of these meetings. 10 points means to spent a significant amount of time outside of class working on this course and you are on topic.  I don’t put an hour amount on “significant amount”, but think of how much time you put in every two weeks in your hardest class and shoot for that. 5 points means to spent about half of what I expect outside of class. 0 means you didn’t do anything. You can get any score between 10 and 0. Note that it’s obvious if you just crammed something together the hour before your lab time. That’s a great way to get a 1 or 2. If you don’t show up to your lab without communicating with me, you’ll also get a 0. If you’re sick, etc., just email me before class and we’ll arrange another time to review what you’re doing. To help in grading, I'll invite you to submit your own grade for the sprint. I've found that most students  will be honest and they have a much better idea of how much work they have done.

There will also be a short presentation at the end of class. By short I mean 120 seconds or less—I’m looking for your elevator speech about what you did in this class. 2 minutes is way too short to cover everything you’ve learned, so focus your comments. My goal is to train you to concisely answer this question during an interview: ‘So what did you do in this class…” The grade on this presentation will be worth 5 to 10 labs, making it a big part of your grade. We’ll discuss the details as we approach the end of the semester.
