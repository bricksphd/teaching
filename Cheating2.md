The cheating policy in this course is composed on three documents: the Universitites policy on academic integrity, the Computer Science Department policy on academic integrity, and this document (the academic integrity polcies, or AIPs). When determining if an activity violates academic integrity and what the consequence will be, the stricter of the AIPs will apply.

# Academic Integrity

The goal of this specific policy is to clarify how you can use resources without violating academic integrity.

## Blantant Cheating

Blatant Cheatinge. Any activity that a reasonable student would consider cheating will be treated as a violation of academic integrity.

## Your Code

You may code and paste code you wrote (that doesn't violate any of the AIPs) without needed to cite the source or transcribe it.

## The Instructor's Code

The instructor for this class may provide resources during class for students, include slides, in-class notes, and code. You may use any code that the instructor makes available. You do not need to cite the instructor. You may not copy and paste the instructor's code, however, and you need to transcribe it.

## All Other Resources

To understand this policy about other resources (including but not limited to people, websites, videos, generative AI), you need to consider what the contect provides and how it relates to the given assignment.

1. High-level resources: A high-level resource provides a description of an algorithm but at a very high level. These resources provide a brief overview of a topic and do not explain any of the low-level details. You may use high-level resources without citing them.
2. Low-level resources. A low-level resource provides details about an algorithm's implementation without provided actual code. You may use low-level resources for all assignments, but you must cite them.
3. Code resources. A code resource provides actual code for an algorithm. In general, the policy is that you should not use code resources, instead you should study high and low-level resources and then practice generating code yourself.
   1. Exception: There are times when it is approprite to use code resources to resolve syntax errors. In cases where this is the case, you may use a code resource. You must cite such a resource. You must transcribe the code instead of copy and pasting it.

FAQ

I’m using a resource that provides both low-level and code resources. What should I do? 
This happens frequently when you use the internet to help you understand a concept. Just read/watch/etc. the low-level information and skip the actual code.

What does it mean to transcribe code? Transcribing code means you type it out on a keyboard instead of copying and pasting. This helps you learn the content better.

What about ChatGPT/Copilot/Bard etc? You may use these resources as long as you are only using them to learn high-level concepts or low-level concepts in accrdance with the policy above. You may not use any AI resources to generate code or debug code.

I found some code online. Can I use it if I understand it? I can even add comments to every line to show that I undestand it! No, you may only use code if it corresponds to basic syntax of a language. Regardless of how well you understand code you find, you may not use it. I want you to practice taking low-level concepts and turning them into code yourself.

Why do I have to transcribe the instructor’s code instead of copy and pasting it? You need to practice typing your own code. The very act of transcribing code will help you undestand it better and will lead to longer retention.

What should I do if I find a resource that provides both low-level details and code? The happens frequently online; with many Wikipedia pages acting as examples. In this case, study the low-level code as much as you want, but don’t use any code provided.

I have a friend who is good at coding. Can they help with my code? Another person can delp you with your code as long as they are providing high or low-level descriptions. Another person cannot tell you what to type unless they are helping you resolve a syntax error.

What happens if I am accused of an academic integrity violation? You will receive the penalties outlined in the three documents described above. 

What happens if I disagree with the instructor’s decision that I violated acadmeic integrity? You will always be given a chance to discuss the issue with the instructor. If you are not satisfied after such a discussion, you may appeal the decision as described in the aforementioned policy.
