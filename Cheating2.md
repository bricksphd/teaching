The cheating policy in this course is composed on three documents: the Universitites policy on academic integrity, the Computer Science Department policy on academic integrity, and this document (the academic integrity polcies, or AIPs). When determining if an activity violates academic integrity and what the consequence will be, the stricter of the AIPs will apply.

# Academic Integrity

The goal of this specific policy is to clarify how you can use resources without violating academic integrity

## Blantant Cheating

Blatant Cheatinge. Any activity that a reasonable student would consider cheating will be treated as a violation of academic integrity.

## Your Code

You may code and paste code you wrote (that doesn't violate any of the AIPs) without needed to cite the source or transcribe it.

## The Instructor's Code

The instructor for this class may provide resources during class for students, include slides, in-class notes, and code. You may use any code that the instructor makes available. You do not need to cite the instructor. You may not copy and paste the instructor's code, however, and you need to transcribe it.

## All Other Resources

To understand this policy about other resources (including but not limited to people, websites, videos, generative AI), you need to consider what the contect provides and how it relates to the given assignment.

1. High-level resources: A high-level resource provides a description of an algorithm but at a very high level. These resources provide a brief overview of a topic and do not explain any of the low-level details. You may use high-level resources without citing them.
2. Low-level resources. A low-level resource provides details about an algorithm's implementation without provided actual code. You may use low-level resources for all assignments, but you must cite them.
3. Code resources. A code resource provides actual code for an algorithm. In general, the policy is that you should not use code resources, instead you should study high and low-level resources and then practice generating code yourself.
   1. Exception: There are times when it is approprite to use code resources to resolve syntax errors. In cases where this is the case, you may use a code resource. You must cite such a resource. You must transcribe the code instead of copy and pasting it.
